1. DNS Request (Domain Name System)

When you type https://x.com/saraali20180/status/2001021876597088652?s=46 your browser cannot communicate directly using the domain name. Computers communicate using IP addresses.

So the first step is a DNS lookup:

The browser checks its cache to see if it already knows the IP address for google.com.

If not found, it asks the operating system.

If still not found, the request goes to a DNS resolver (usually provided by your ISP).

The resolver queries DNS servers (root → TLD → authoritative DNS).

The authoritative DNS server responds with Google’s IP address.

Now the browser knows where to send the request.

2. TCP/IP Connection

Once the IP address is known, the browser establishes a connection using the TCP/IP protocol.

This happens through the TCP three-way handshake:

The client sends a SYN packet.

The server responds with SYN-ACK.

The client sends ACK.

This handshake ensures that both sides are ready to send and receive data reliably.

3. Firewall

Before the request reaches Google’s servers, it passes through firewalls.

Firewalls:

Check if the request is allowed

Block malicious traffic

Protect internal networks

Both the client side and server side may have firewalls that inspect and filter traffic.

4. HTTPS / SSL (TLS Handshake)

Because the URL starts with https, a secure connection is required.

The browser performs an SSL/TLS handshake:

The browser requests a secure connection.

The server sends its SSL certificate.

The browser verifies the certificate with a trusted Certificate Authority.

A secure encryption key is established.

After this, all data exchanged is encrypted, ensuring privacy and security.

5. Load Balancer

Google receives millions of requests per second, so requests do not go to a single server.

A load balancer:

Distributes incoming requests across multiple servers

Improves performance

Prevents server overload

Increases availability

The load balancer chooses the best server to handle your request.

6. Web Server

The request now reaches a web server (such as Nginx or Apache).

The web server:

Handles HTTP requests

Serves static files (HTML, CSS, images)

Forwards dynamic requests to the application server

If the request requires dynamic content, it is passed to the application layer.

7. Application Server

The application server processes business logic.

For Google, this includes:

Understanding the request

Processing search logic

Communicating with databases

Applying ranking algorithms

The application server prepares the response data.

8. Database

If data is required, the application server queries the database.

Databases store:

Search indexes

User data

Configuration data

The database responds with the requested data, which is then processed by the application server.

9. Response Back to the Browser

The application server sends the processed data back to the web server.
The web server sends an HTTP response back through:

Load balancer

Secure TLS connection

TCP/IP

The browser receives the response.

10. Browser Rendering

Finally, the browser:

Parses the HTML

Builds the DOM and CSSOM

Executes JavaScript

Renders the page on the screen

You now see Google’s homepage ready for interaction.

Conclusion

Typing a simple URL into a browser triggers a complex chain of events involving DNS, networking, security, servers, and databases.
Understanding this flow demonstrates a strong foundation in web architecture and networking, which is essential for modern software engineering roles.
